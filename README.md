# Chatbot Project (React + FastAPI)

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered chatbot built using **React (TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS + Lucide React Icons** for the frontend, and **FastAPI** for the backend. It utilizes **LangChain, Groq, and FAISS, and Hugging Face models** for natural language processing and vectorized data storage.

### Features

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript for a smooth user experience.
- **Backend:** FastAPI for handling API requests and AI model processing.
- **AI Processing:** Hugging Face models, LangChain for AI workflows, and Groq for optimized AI inference.
- **Vector Database:** FAISS for fast and efficient similarity searches.
- **Hosting:** The frontend is deployed on Vercel.

**Note:** This project is built **only for educational purposes** related to Data Science and AI.
